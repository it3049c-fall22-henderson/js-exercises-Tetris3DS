## Self-Evaluation: 
(For this assignment, there was 22 exercises checked by 68 automated checks)
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:

I passed 19 checks, leaving only 4 failed. I'm still new to the npm test system, but I'm unsure of how I can fix the answers I got wrong. I seem to have gotten 19 passed out of 23 total which is 82%, but I know I got more than 82% wrong. I worked incredibly hard to try and find solutions to many problems, but I either could not find adequate solutions, or I received little to no valuable feedback. Additionally I started late then I should have any I failed to ask for help from the Professor or his TA.

I would give myself a 10 out of 20.

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- What did you learn that you found interesting -->
I'm very confused about many of these concepts and I feel like the resources available to me don't adequately explain many of these concepts. I hope to ask for help sooner in future labs, and I plan on asking the Professor about many of these difficulties I have had. Additionally the npm test system doesn't provide any feedback for why I failed these tests, I feel like there should be more examples or possibly answers that we could access.
